// vectorized copy, the remaining win (skipping the copy) is offset by the
// padded direct read's worse kernel cache locality (full-frame stride vs the
// L1-resident tile) plus the per-frame expand/copy cost. Kept UNWIRED as a ready
// option for a workload/target where tile extraction dominates (e.g. slower
// memory, or hand-asm kernels tuned for the big-stride read). To wire: store
